#Pokémon Foundations

Pokémon Foundations is a replacement server and class library for Pokémon
Generations 4 and 5.

##How to connect
AltWFC is configured to automatically direct you to my servers. Follow the
[instructions](https://github.com/polaris-/dwc_network_server_emulator/wiki) 
at their wiki to connect.

##What works
* GTS
* Battle Videos
* Dressup (PtHGSS)
* Box uploads (PtHGSS)
* Musical photos (BW1/2)

Direct communications are handled by 
[AltWFC](https://github.com/polaris-/dwc_network_server_emulator) and are
outside the scope of this  project. They work at the time of writing but 
haven't been tested that thoroughly.

##What doesn't
* Wi-fi Battle Tower/Subway
* Top Trainers (PtHGSS)
* Wi-fi Plaza (PtHGSS)
* Game Sync
* Rating Battles / Competitions

##What's planned
* Wi-fi Battle Tower/Subway
* A much more awesome website
* Cheat detection
* Stat checking in a similar manner as Pokécheck
* Game Sync (I will need help with this!)

##How you can help
If there's something you want to see, the best thing is to discuss it with me
and prepare a pull request.
The most significant way you can help is simply by using it. Its users are
the GTS. Get on there and start trading!
